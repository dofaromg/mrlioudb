# Execution Laws (E-1 to E-5)

## Purpose
Execution Laws define how Root Laws are enacted, validated, and enforced.

## Format
```
E-<number>: <title>
- Statement: <single-sentence rule>
- Enforcement: <process or authority>
- Evidence: <pointers to Evidence_Index entries>
```

## Laws

**E-1: Automated Compliance Verification**
- Statement: All Root Laws must be automatically verified through code review, linting, and testing pipelines before deployment.
- Enforcement: GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows configured in this repository (build, lint, and deployment checks)
- Evidence: EV-101 (CI/CD configuration), EV-102 (test suites)
- Related Root Laws: All laws
- Implementation:
  - CI workflows run automated build and lint steps on code changes
  - Security and quality scanners are added to the CI workflows as they are introduced
  - Dedicated test scripts (for example `python test_integration.py`, `python test_comprehensive.py`) validate functional requirements
  - GitHub Actions workflows enforce the configured checks on pull requests

**E-2: Exception Handling and Escalation**
- Statement: Violations of Root Laws must be logged, reported, and escalated according to severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Enforcement: Logging framework with severity levels, alert system integration, violation tracking in Evidence_Index.md
- Evidence: EV-103 (logging implementation), EV-104 (alert configuration)
- Related Root Laws: Law 22 (Error Propagation), Law 28 (Logging Requirements)
- Severity Levels:
  - Critical: System security breach, data corruption (immediate escalation)
  - High: Data integrity violation, service failure (escalate within 1 hour)
  - Medium: Performance degradation, non-critical errors (escalate within 24 hours)
  - Low: Minor inconsistencies, warnings (log and monitor)

**E-3: Progressive Enforcement**
- Statement: New Root Laws must be introduced with a grace period allowing gradual adoption before strict enforcement.
- Enforcement: Phased rollout with warnings → errors → blocking transitions over 30-90 days
- Evidence: EV-105 (enforcement timeline), EV-106 (migration guides)
- Related Root Laws: Law 32 (Backward Compatibility), Law 41 (Documentation Synchronization)
- Phases:
  1. Warning Phase (30 days): Violations logged but not blocking
  2. Error Phase (30 days): Violations cause failures in new code only
  3. Blocking Phase (ongoing): All violations prevent deployment

**E-4: Remediation and Waiver Process**
- Statement: Critical systems may request temporary waivers from specific laws with documented justification and remediation plans.
- Enforcement: Waiver request form, approval from repository maintainer, documented in Evidence_Index.md with expiration date
- Evidence: EV-107 (waiver registry), EV-108 (approval process)
- Related Root Laws: Law 23 (Graceful Degradation), Law 42 (Change Traceability)
- Requirements:
  - Written justification explaining why compliance is not feasible
  - Risk assessment and mitigation plan
  - Maximum waiver duration: 90 days
  - Remediation plan with specific timeline
  - Regular review every 30 days

**E-5: Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**
- Statement: Root Laws must be reviewed quarterly and updated based on system evolution, security threats, and operational feedback.
- Enforcement: Quarterly review meetings, feedback collection from development team, update proposals tracked as GitHub issues
- Evidence: EV-109 (review meeting notes), EV-110 (law evolution history)
- Related Root Laws: Law 13 (Metadata Completeness), Law 19 (Schema Versioning)
- Review Process:
  1. Collect feedback from developers, security team, and operations
  2. Analyze violation patterns and common waiver requests
  3. Propose law additions, modifications, or deprecations
  4. Update Evidence_Index.md with version history
  5. Communicate changes through documentation and training
  6. Update Progress_Snapshot.md with review anchor
