## Stakeholder Communication

### Communication Log
| Date | Type | Audience | Topic | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-01-26 | Documentation | All developers | RootLaw Package v1.0 release | This file, all RootLaw docs |

### Upcoming Communications
- **2026-04-26**: Quarterly review results and law updates
- **As needed**: New law rollout announcements (E-3 progressive enforcement)

## Notes and Observations

### Implementation Insights
- The FlowOS flow-law.ts module already implements subset of laws (2, 3)
- Particle core system naturally aligns with laws due to design philosophy
- UTF-8 encoding and versioning already widespread - formalization was needed
- CI/CD infrastructure ready for automated compliance (E-1)

### Areas for Improvement
- Rate limiting (Law 26) needs attention for external API integrations
- Graceful degradation (Law 23) could be more systematic
- Concurrent access control (Law 25) limited to database, could expand to file system

### Success Metrics
- **Documentation coverage**: 100% of laws have evidence
- **Cross-reference integrity**: All law references validated
- **Implementation coverage**: ~95% of laws have active implementation
- **Conflict resolution**: 5 historical conflicts documented and resolved
