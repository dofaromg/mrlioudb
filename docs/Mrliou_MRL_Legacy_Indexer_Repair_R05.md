Guard source: `dofaromg/flow-tasks@d43e53dee1012571915754afdfeff66c96c19615` (R03).

Fix: repair invalid YAML together with fail-closed scan/generate/upload authorization.
Backport the R03 direct-method, recursive, depth, path, revocation, smart-updater and
upload gates. Bind grants to this repository. Add an empty DENY registry; no grant
is created. Remove automatic main push and structure-content log/summary output.
Preserve the original workflow event/schedule/path section byte for byte.
The original five modified files are retained under `docs/Mrliou_MRL_Legacy_Indexer_Repair_R05_original`.

R07 review candidate, prepared for the isolated branch
`Mrliou/mrl-authorization-repair-r07`. The implementation is the tested R05
backport. R07 updates this delivery status and its manifest; code is unchanged.
Production is NOT_APPLIED until a separately reviewed merge. No main ref,
history, App permission, deployment configuration or existing route is changed
by preparing this candidate. Remote PR status belongs in the R07 repair ledger.
Existing branch/PR workflows may run under their unchanged trigger rules.

Run: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_Mrliou_structure_authorization.py -v`
Tests use disposable synthetic repositories, never Mother content. Python 3.10+,
standard library only; offline YAML validation additionally uses PyYAML.

The manifest lists the exact payload, SHA-256, sizes and dependencies. Its own
bytes are excluded from its internal payload hash to avoid self-reference.
Before application, verify the exact repository/base and all original blobs.
Apply on a new isolated review branch only; validate CI there before considering
any separately authorized protected merge. Rollback by reverting the candidate
commit; do not rewrite history. Historical artifact download/use remains OPEN.

R07 CI correction: the existing runner-version job name referenced the env
context where GitHub does not allow it. Replace only that display name with
a static label. The version threshold, comparison steps and path/event routing
are unchanged. The candidate payload is now 16 files. Existing Neural Branch
Sync may append two graph files; those extra changes are tracked separately
in the R07 ledger and require review. Billing and application CI remain
separate from the 47 targeted authorization tests.

R08 CI dependency correction: FlowAgent task validation invokes npm lint and
next build, but the workflow installed Python dependencies only. Add Node 24
and npm ci before validation. Existing checks, failure behavior, privacy
redaction and event routes are unchanged. This is a 17-file review candidate;
remote CI outcomes are recorded separately, not assumed to pass.

R08 follow-up: preserve historical neural nodes and edges from the existing
working graph and tracked origin/main baseline. Absent current branches receive
historical_only=true; original IDs, fields and timestamps remain. Reject foreign
origins, malformed history and orphan historical edges. Four synthetic tests
include recovery from a tracked Git baseline. No main ref or service route is
changed. Repositories lacking Flask now use the existing sibling declaration
flask>=3.0.0 required by hello_api.py; no validation is disabled.
